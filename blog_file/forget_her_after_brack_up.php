<h3><li>Accept What Happened but Don\'t Dwell on it</h3></br>

It is normal to be upset, mad and hurt after break-ups especially if it\'s a third party issue. And you\'d probably be mad for a long time. But if you stay mad you\'d only stress yourself and you\'d only make your world smaller. You have to accept that the relationship is over and don\'t even try to pick up the pieces because you\'d only hurt yourself. Acceptance is the first step to moving on and getting over that stupid ex, so its time for you to make that first step. Once you\'ve accepted it, don\'t dwell on it. Don\'t over-think and over-analyze things. Don\'t dwell on the "what\'ifs or what might have beens" in the relationship. It\'s fruitless. Believe me, I\'ve tried and it only made me feel worse than I have ever been.</br></br>

You can choose to avoid thinking about him or her and causing yourself suffering. It’s not easy, but you can do it.</br></br>

A good way to think is by journaling about your feelings. It doesn\'t have to be the best writing or even good writing at all. Just get it all out there. Imagine that as you write them down, the bad feelings and thoughts are leaving your body and sticking to the paper.</li>

<h3><li>Give yourself time to forget your ex – it doesn’t happen overnight</h3></br></br>

“I need this guilt and pain to just go away,” says Callie, a reader who emailed me about her breakup. “I can’t even be happy anymore and it’s been four months, normally after a relationship breakup I’d be getting fine by now, but this is a tremendous hurt for me.” There is no “normal” amount of time for healing – it takes some people years, while others can bounce back more quickly. To get over a breakup when you still love him, focus on what you love about yourself, your life, and your future.</li>

<h3><li>Use your personal space.</h3></br>
Maybe you own a home; maybe you only have half a bedroom to call your own. Whatever the case, find times and places where you can be alone with your thoughts, and let them come naturally. When you have personal space, you have no restrictions on your thoughts. Knowing you have a place where you can be totally honest with yourself will help you cope with your anger and sadness in other areas of your life.</br></br>

<ul>
<li>If you don\'t have any useful space at home, try visiting a nearby park or schoolyard at a time when few other people are using it. Find an out-of-the-way corner and stay there for a while.</li>
<li>If your personal space reminds you of your ex-girlfriend, rearrange it. Take down and hide anything that reminds you of your time together, and give the whole area a fresh look by moving furniture, changing decorations, or donating/selling extra stuff.</li>
<li>Consider meditation during your personal time, to help you sort things out in your head. There are various meditation methods; the most basic is to sit and breathe evenly, focusing on the physical sensation of your own body, until your thoughts become clearer and less overwhelming.</li>
</ul></li>

<h3><li>Go Outside and Be Active</h3></br>

I understand that you want to be alone and I respect that. Everyone deserves some alone time with themselves and I\'m not going to deny you that opportunity. When you are alone, you can think things through but don\'t overdo it.</br></br>

Do not stay indoors for long. Go out. Enjoy the outdoors. Socialize with your friends. This will give you less time to think about your ex. Bask in the sun or go some place else with your family members. This will definitely give you a better view of the world you once lived in...the world without your stupid ex...Don\'t forget that you once lived without him/her so it won\'t definitely ruin your life now that you are back to where you once were... your life isn\'t over now that they\'re gone.</br></br>

Also, exercising, sunlight, and fresh air will all help you to be healthier which will make your body feel good. Soon enough, your heart will start feeling better too.</li>

<h3><li>Don\'t Be A White Bear</h3></br>
There\'s one guaranteed way to make sure you never forget your ex: Try to push him out of your mind completely. Psychologists call this the "White Bear Effect." If you try not to think about a white bear, one will assuredly pop into your mind. This is true for all kinds of temptations. Dieters who try not to think about chocolate become obsessed with it (and eat more of it). Smokers who try not to think about cigarettes only end up smoking more. One study even found that if you try not to think about an old flame, you\'re more likely to dream about him or her. So when an ex comes to mind, don\'t panic, and certainly don\'t take it as some kind of sign. Remind yourself why he or she\'s an ex, then put your attention back on someone you really care about—you.

<h3><li>Avoid asking about him</h3></br>

Even if you and your ex have a million mutual friends, you should avoid asking about how he\'s/she\'s doing -- or, worse, asking if he\'s/she\'s seeing anyone else -- this will only make you want to be near him/her even more. And if you\'re always asking about him/her, it\'s likely that he\'s/she\'s going to find out.</br></br>

If you do have a lot of mutual friends, you can even tell him that you\'d prefer it if they didn\'t mention him too much around you. Though this may sound like an extreme move, they\'ll understand and will make you feel better.</li>

</br></br>







<h3><li>Make New Memories</h3></br>

To get your ex out of your system, you have to create new memories. If you visited some places together in the past, you need to go to a new spot that you’ve never been before. Better yet, go to somewhere you went together but this time do it with your loved ones and friends. Eat foods you’ve never tasted before. Try a different sport.</br></br>

Do something you never thought you’d do like bungee jumping, skydiving, ziplining, rock climbing, or anything else! If you create new memories, you will have a better chance at forgetting your ex, and in the process, you\'ll discover many more things that you are capable of, things you never thought you could do.

<h3><li>Cut all Contact With Your Ex as Much as Possible</h3></br>

Your ex might still want to contact you even after breakup. If this happens, it will certainly make it harder for you to forget him. Be respectful but mindful of your needs. You can change your number (or block his), and delete his number from your contact list. If you memorized his number, you will really have to discipline yourself and do your best not to contact him.</br></br>

Try to memorize other important phone numbers. Keep busy so you won\'t even have time to think of contacting him. In time, you\'ll be surprised that you don\'t remember his phone number anymore.</br></br>

Unfollow him or block him on all your social media accounts, and delete all your old messages and emails so you don’t spend any time going through them. Make a new email address to make it even more effective. The urge to contact him will wane little by little until you don’t remember him at all.

<h3><li>Get help if you or your ex has emotional issues, such as depression</h3></li></br>

Psychological or emotional health issues have serious effects on love relationships. If you, your ex, or your current boyfriend are dealing with depression, anxiety, or other issues, I encourage you to talk to a counselor. You don’t necessarily need to get counseling for months or years; even just calling a local help line can help you gain clarity and insight. If you want to heal a broken heart, you need to face your issues head on.

<h3><li>Love Again</h3>
</br></br>
This is the ultimate way to get over your ex. Even though your past relationship didn\'t work, it shouldn\'t stop you from loving again. Try not to close your heart to a new possibility of a love that is better, bolder, and greater than the previous one. Smile and be hopeful. There is someone who is right for you, someone who will be thankful to have you, someone who will treasure and respect you more than anyone else.</br></br>

You will find a new love that will make you grow more mature and inspired in your everyday life. And who knows, the next person could even be the one you decide to spend the rest of your life with.</br></br>

That\'s it folks. That’s my advice. If I was able to get over my ex, I am sure that you will too. Even though it feels like it, it is not the end of the world. There is still someone out there waiting for you who will find you no matter what.</br></br>

Be thankful and learn from your past and use that to become a better and more lovable person. Realize that there are different kinds of people that we are meant to meet in life. Some of them are just passing by to give us lessons, some will make us stronger, some are meant to show us what real world is like and there are some who will stay with us forever.</br></br>

Love yourself more and you\'ll see that new love is coming along soon enough.</li>
