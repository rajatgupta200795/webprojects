If you want to shine like a sun, first burn like a sun. - <b>A. P. J. Abdul Kalam</b>
</br></br>

If a man is called to be a streetsweeper,</br>
he should sweep streets even as Michelangelo painted,</br>
or Beethoven composed music, or Shakespeare wrote poetry.</br>
He should sweep streets so well that all the hosts</br>
of heaven and earth will pause to say,</br>
here lived a great streetsweeper who did his job well. —<b>Martin Luther King</b></br></br>
